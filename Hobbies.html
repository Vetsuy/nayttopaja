          <h3>Tennis</h3>
          <p>
            Tennis is one of my favourite summer sports, I usually play tennis in open areas from June until August.
          </p>
          <h3>Basketball</h3>
          <p>
            I started playing basketball when I was 15 years old in the school where i learned it, 
            and I'm still very motivated about it. I often play basketball during the weekend.
          </p>
          <h3>Videogames</h3>
          <p>
            When the weather is not too good for outdoor activities,
            I gather my friends online and start playing for a couple of hours.
          </p>
          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>
            When It's either Snowy or Sunny it is the best time to practice my photography hobbies with my camera.
            Street photography is one of my favorite types of photography.
          </p>
          <h3>Yoga</h3>
          <p>
            Yoga is the best solution for relaxing and freeing my mind when there is many tasks to do.
          </p>
          <h3>Vlogging</h3>
          <p>
            Shooting daily vlogs if i have free time is one of the nice activities to do.
            For example sharing the cultural events on social media is benificial to spreading and sharing the finnish culture out.
